# Orders System Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive orders system for your electronics store that integrates seamlessly with your existing cart and authentication system.

## New Files Created

### 1. `orders.py` - Orders Router
- **`/orders/`** - View all user orders
- **`/orders/create`** - Create order from cart (POST)
- **`/orders/{order_id}`** - View specific order details
- **`/orders/{order_id}/cancel`** - Cancel an order (POST)
- **`/orders/track/{order_id}`** - Track order progress
- **`/orders/admin/all`** - Admin view of all orders
- **`/orders/admin/{order_id}/status`** - Admin update order status

### 2. Templates
- **`orders.html`** - Main orders listing page
- **`order_details.html`** - Detailed order view
- **`track_order.html`** - Order tracking with progress timeline

### 3. Database Integration
- Added `orders` collection to `utils.py`
- Orders stored with complete order information including items, status, tracking

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Order Management**
- Create orders from cart items
- View order history with pagination
- Order status tracking (Processing → In Transit → Delivered)
- Cancel orders (if not delivered/cancelled)
- Order details with itemized breakdown

### ✅ **Modern UI/UX**
- Responsive design matching your site theme
- Status badges with color coding
- Interactive filter dropdown
- Progress timeline for order tracking
- Empty state when no orders exist

### ✅ **Order Data Structure**
```python
{
    "order_id": "ORD-ABC12345",
    "user_id": "user_uid",
    "order_date": datetime,
    "status": "Processing|In Transit|Delivered|Cancelled",
    "total": 1299.99,
    "tracking_number": "TRK1234567890",
    "estimated_delivery": datetime,
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "Product Name",
            "product_img": "/path/image.jpg",
            "price": 999.99,
            "quantity": 1,
            "description": "Product description"
        }
    ],
    "shipping_address": {
        "name": "Customer Name",
        "email": "customer@email.com"
    },
    "payment_status": "Paid",
    "created_at": datetime,
    "updated_at": datetime
}
```

### ✅ **Integration Updates**
- Updated `main.py` to include orders router
- Updated `cart.html` with functional checkout button
- Added logout functionality to `/logout` route
- Updated dropdown in header with working links

## How to Test

### 1. **Setup Sample Data**
```bash
cd /Users/sandeeppurwar/StudioProjects/electronics-store
python create_sample_orders.py
```

### 2. **Access Orders**
- **Demo Mode**: Visit `/orders?demo=true` to see sample data
- **With Authentication**: Login and visit `/orders`
- **From Header**: Click Account → My Orders

### 3. **Test Order Creation**
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to `/cart`
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. View created order in `/orders`

## Key Functionality

### **Order Creation Flow**
1. User adds items to cart
2. Clicks "Proceed to Checkout" in cart
3. System creates order from cart items
4. Cart is cleared
5. User redirected to orders page

### **Order Tracking**
- Visual progress timeline
- Status updates with timestamps
- Estimated delivery dates
- Tracking number display

### **Admin Features** (Future Enhancement)
- View all orders across users
- Update order statuses
- Order management dashboard

## Routes Added to Main App

```python
# In main.py
from orders import orders_router
app.include_router(orders_router)

# New route for logout
@app.get("/logout")
def logout(request: Request):
    # Clears all authentication cookies
```

## Database Schema

### Orders Collection
- Stores complete order information
- Links to users via `user_id`
- Includes order items, status, tracking info

### Integration with Existing System
- Uses existing `uid` cookie for user identification
- Integrates with existing cart system in `users` collection
- Maintains compatibility with current authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Run the sample data script** to populate test orders
2. **Test the order flow** from cart to orders
3. **Customize order statuses** as needed for your business
4. **Add admin authentication** for admin order management
5. **Implement email notifications** for order status updates

## Design Features

- **Color-coded status badges** for visual order states
- **Responsive design** works on mobile and desktop
- **Interactive elements** with hover effects
- **Timeline visualization** for order tracking
- **Consistent styling** with your existing teal theme

The orders system is now fully integrated and ready for use! The design matches your existing cart and header styling perfectly.
